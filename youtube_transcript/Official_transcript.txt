Although
 I
 am
 very
 interested
 in
 the


subject
 of
 human
 misjudgment
 and
 Lord


knows
 I've
 created
 my
 well
 a
 good
 bit
 of


it.
 I
 don't
 think
 I've
 created
 my
 full


statistical
 share.
 And


uh
 I
 think
 that
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 was


the
 I
 tried
 to
 do
 something
 about
 this


terrible
 ignorance
 I
 left
 the
 Harvard


Law
 School
 with
 when
 I
 saw
 this


patterned
 irrationality
 which
 was
 so


extreme.
 And
 I
 had
 no
 theory
 or
 anything


to
 to
 to
 deal
 with
 it.
 But
 I
 could
 see


that
 it
 was
 extreme
 and
 I
 could
 see
 that


it
 was
 patterned.
 I
 just
 started
 to


create
 my
 own
 system
 of
 psychology
 uh


partly
 by
 casual
 reading
 but
 largely


from
 personal
 experience
 and
 I
 used
 that


pattern
 to
 help
 me
 get
 through


life.
 Fairly
 late
 in
 life
 I
 stumbled


into
 this
 book
 influence
 by
 a


psychologist
 named
 Bob
 Seelini
 who


became
 a
 super
 tenured
 hot
 shot
 on
 a


2,000
 person
 faculty
 at
 a
 very
 young


age.


uh
 and
 he
 wrote
 this
 book
 which
 has
 now


sold
 300
 odd
 thousand
 copies
 which
 is


remarkable
 for
 uh
 semi
 well
 it's
 a


academic
 book
 aimed
 at
 a
 popular


audience
 and
 uh
 and
 that
 filled
 in
 a
 lot


of
 holes
 in
 my
 crude
 system
 and
 when


those
 holes
 had
 had
 filled
 in
 I
 uh
 I


thought
 I
 had
 a
 system
 that
 was
 a
 good


working
 tool
 and
 I'd
 like
 to
 uh
 share


that
 one
 with
 you
 and
 I
 came
 here


Because
 behavioral
 economics,
 how
 could


economics
 not
 be
 behavioral?
 If
 it
 isn't


behavioral,
 what
 the
 hell
 is
 it?


Uh
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 fairly
 clear
 that


all
 reality
 has
 to
 respect
 all
 other


reality.
 If
 you
 come
 to
 inconsistencies,


they
 have
 to
 be
 resolved.
 And
 uh
 so
 the


idea
 of
 if
 there's
 anything
 valid
 in


psychology,
 economics
 has
 to
 recognize


it
 and
 and
 vice
 versa.
 So
 I
 think
 the


people
 that
 are
 working
 on
 this
 fringe


between
 economics
 and
 and
 psych
 and


psychology
 are
 are
 absolutely
 right
 to


be
 there.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 been


plenty
 wrong
 over
 the
 years.
 Well,
 let


me
 romp
 through
 my
 as
 much
 of
 this
 list


as
 I
 have
 time
 to
 get
 through.
 24


standard
 causes
 of
 of
 human
 misjudgment.


first
 under
 recognition
 of
 the
 power
 of


what
 psychologists
 call
 reinforcement


and
 economic
 and
 economists
 call


incentives.
 Well,
 you
 can
 say
 everybody


knows
 that.
 Well,
 I
 think
 I've
 been
 in


the
 top
 5%
 of
 my
 age
 cohort
 all
 my
 life


in
 understanding
 the
 power
 of
 incentives


and
 all
 my
 life
 I've
 underestimated
 it


and
 never
 a
 year
 passes
 but
 I
 get
 some


surprise
 that
 push
 pushes
 my
 limit
 a


little
 farther.
 So,
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


cases
 about
 the
 power
 of
 incentives,


power
 of
 incentives
 is
 the
 Federal


Express
 case
 where
 heart
 and
 soul
 of
 the


integrity
 of
 the
 system
 is
 that
 all
 the


packages
 have
 to
 be
 shipped
 rapidly
 in


one
 central
 location
 each
 night.
 And
 the


system
 has
 no
 integrity
 if
 the
 whole


shift
 can't
 be
 done
 fast.
 And
 Federal


Express
 had
 one
 hell
 of
 a
 time
 getting


the
 thing
 to
 work.
 And
 they
 tried
 moral


persuasion.
 They
 tried
 everything
 in
 the


world.
 And
 finally,
 somebody
 got
 the


happy
 thought
 that
 they
 were
 paying
 the


night
 shift
 by
 the
 hour
 and
 that
 maybe


if
 they
 paid
 them
 by
 the
 shift,
 the


system
 would
 work
 better.
 And
 lo
 and


behold,
 that
 solution
 worked.
 Early
 in


the
 history
 of
 Xerox,
 Joe
 Wilson,
 who


was
 then
 in
 the
 government,
 had
 to
 go


back
 to
 Xerox
 because
 he
 couldn't


understand
 why
 their
 better
 new
 machine


was
 selling
 so
 poorly
 in
 relation
 to


their
 older
 and
 inferior
 machine.
 Of


course,
 when
 he
 got
 there,
 he
 found
 out


that
 the
 commission
 arrangement
 with
 the


salesman
 gave
 a
 tremendous
 incentive
 to


the
 inferior


machine.
 And
 uh
 here
 at
 Harvard
 in
 the


shadow
 of
 BF
 Skinner,


uh
 there
 was
 a
 man
 who
 really
 was
 into


reinforcement
 as
 a


powerful
 as
 a
 powerful
 thought.


And
 you
 know,
 Skinner
 has
 lost
 his


reputation
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 places,
 but
 if


you
 were


to
 analyze
 the
 entire
 history
 of


experimental
 science
 at
 Harvard,
 he'd
 be


in
 the
 top
 handful.
 His
 experiments
 were


very
 ingenious.
 The
 results
 were


counterintuitive
 and
 they
 were


important.
 It
 is
 not
 given
 to


experimental
 science
 to
 do
 better.
 What


gummed
 up
 Skinner's
 reputation
 is
 that


he
 developed
 a
 case
 of
 what
 I
 always


call
 man
 with
 a
 hammer
 syndrome.
 To
 the


man
 with
 a
 hammer,
 every
 problem
 tends


to
 look
 pretty
 much
 like
 a
 nail.
 And
 and


Skinner
 had
 one
 of
 the
 more
 extreme


cases
 in
 the
 history
 of
 academia.
 And


this
 syndrome
 doesn't
 exempt
 bright


people.
 It's
 just
 a
 man
 with
 a
 hammer.


And
 Skinner
 is
 a
 extreme
 example
 of


that.
 And
 uh
 later
 as
 I
 go
 down
 my
 list,


let's
 go
 back
 and
 try
 and
 figure
 out
 why


people
 like
 Skinner
 get
 man
 with
 a


hammer
 syndrome.
 Incidentally,
 when
 I


was
 at
 the
 Harvard
 Law
 School,
 there
 was


a
 professor
 naturally
 at
 Yale
 who
 uh
 was


derisively
 discussed
 at
 Harvard
 and
 they


used
 to
 say,
 "Poor
 old
 Blanchard,
 he


thinks
 declaratory
 judgments
 will
 cure


cancer."
 And
 and
 that's
 the
 way
 Skinner


got.
 And
 uh
 and
 not
 only
 that
 he
 got


very
 uh
 he
 was
 literary
 and
 he
 scorned


opponents
 who
 had
 any
 different
 way
 of


thinking
 or
 thought
 anything
 else
 was


important.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 way
 to
 make
 a


lasting
 reputation
 if
 the
 other
 people


turn
 out
 to
 also
 be
 doing
 something


important.
 My
 second
 factor
 is
 simple


psychological
 denial.
 This
 first
 really


hit
 me
 between
 the
 eyes
 when
 a
 friend
 of


our
 family
 had


a
 super
 athlete,
 super
 student
 son
 who


flew
 off
 a
 carrier
 in
 the
 North
 Atlantic


and
 never
 came
 back.
 And
 his
 mother,
 who


had
 was
 a
 very
 sane
 woman,
 just
 never


believed
 he
 was
 dead.
 And
 of
 course,
 if


you
 turn
 on
 the
 television,
 you
 find
 the


mothers
 of
 the
 most
 obvious
 criminals


that
 man
 could
 ever
 diagnose.
 And
 they


all
 think
 their
 sons
 are
 innocent.


uh
 simple
 psychological
 denial.
 The


reality
 is
 too
 too
 painful
 to
 bear.
 So


you
 just
 distort
 it
 until
 it's
 bearable.


We
 all
 do
 that
 to
 some
 extent
 and
 uh


it's
 a
 common
 psychological
 misjudgment.


It
 causes
 terrible
 problems.
 Third,


incentive
 caused
 bias
 both
 in
 one's
 own


mind
 and
 that
 of
 one's
 trusted
 advisor


where
 it
 creates
 what
 economists
 call


agency
 costs.


here.
 My
 early
 experience
 was
 a
 doctor


who
 sent
 bushel
 baskets
 full
 of
 normal


gallbladders
 down
 to
 the
 pathology
 lab


in
 a
 leading
 hospital
 in
 Lincoln,


Nebraska.
 And
 with
 that
 quality
 control


for
 which
 community
 hospitals
 are


famous,
 about
 5
 years
 after
 he
 should


have
 been
 removed
 from
 the
 staff,
 he


was.
 And
 uh
 the
 one
 of
 the
 old
 doctors


who
 participated
 in
 the
 removal
 was
 also


a
 family
 friend.
 And
 I
 asked
 him,
 I


said,
 "Tell
 me,
 did
 he
 think
 here's
 a


way
 for
 me
 to
 exercise
 my
 talents."
 This


guy
 was
 very
 skilled
 technically
 and
 uh


and
 and
 make
 a
 high
 living
 by
 doing
 a


few
 mamings
 and
 murders
 every
 year
 along


with
 some
 frauds.
 He
 said,
 "Hell
 no,


Charlie."
 He
 thought
 that
 the


gallbladder
 was
 the
 source
 of
 all


medical
 evil
 and
 that
 if
 you
 really


loved
 your
 patients,
 you
 couldn't
 get


that
 organ
 out
 rapidly
 enough.
 Uh
 now


that's
 an
 extreme
 case
 but


in


lesser
 strength
 it's
 present
 in
 in
 in


every
 profession
 and
 in
 every
 human


being
 and
 uh
 it
 causes


perfectly
 terrible
 behavior.
 If
 you
 take


sales
 presentations
 of
 brokers
 of


commercial
 real
 estate
 and
 business


businesses
 I'm
 70
 years
 old.
 I've
 never


seen
 one
 I
 thought
 was
 even
 within


hailing
 distance
 of
 objective
 truth.


And
 and
 if
 you
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 the


power
 of
 incentives
 and
 the
 power
 to


rationalize
 terrible
 behavior
 after
 the


defense
 department
 had
 had
 enough


experience
 with
 cost
 plus
 percentage
 of


cost
 contracts.
 The
 reaction
 of
 our


republic
 was
 to
 make
 it
 a
 crime
 for
 the


federal
 government
 to
 write
 one.
 And
 not


only
 a
 crime
 but
 a
 felony.
 And
 and
 by


the
 way,
 the
 government's
 right.
 And
 uh


but
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 way
 the
 world
 is
 run,


including
 most
 law
 firms.
 And
 a
 lot
 of


other
 places,
 they've
 still
 got
 a
 cost


plus
 percentage
 of
 cost
 system.
 And


human
 nature
 with
 its
 version
 of
 what
 I


call
 incentive
 caused
 bias
 causes
 this


terrible
 abuse.
 And
 many
 of
 the
 people


who
 are
 doing
 it,
 you
 would
 be
 glad
 to


have
 Mary
 into
 your
 family
 compared
 to


what
 you're
 otherwise
 going
 to
 get.


Now
 there
 are
 huge
 implications
 from


from
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 human
 mind
 is
 is


put
 together
 this
 way
 and
 that
 is
 that


people
 who
 create
 things
 like
 cash


registers
 which
 make
 misbehavior
 hard


are
 some
 of
 the
 effective
 saints
 of
 our


civilization.
 And
 the
 cash
 register
 was


a
 great
 moral
 instrument
 when
 it
 was


created.
 And
 uh
 and
 Patterson
 knew
 that


by
 the
 way
 he
 had
 a
 little
 store
 and


people
 were
 stealing
 him
 blind
 and
 never


made
 any
 money
 and
 people
 sold
 him
 a


couple
 of
 cash
 registers
 and
 it
 went
 to


profit
 immediately
 and
 of
 course
 he


closed
 the
 store
 and
 went
 into
 the
 cash


register
 business
 and
 uh
 with
 results


which
 are
 are
 so
 this
 is
 a
 huge


important
 thing.
 If
 you
 read
 the


psychology
 text,
 you
 will
 find
 that
 if


they're
 a
 thousand
 pages
 long,
 there's


one
 sentence.
 Somehow
 incentive
 caused


bias
 has
 escaped
 the
 standard
 survey


course
 in
 psychology.
 Fourth,
 and
 this


is
 a
 superpower
 in
 error
 causing


psychological
 tendency.
 Bias
 from


consistency
 and
 commitment
 tendency,


including
 the
 tendency
 to
 avoid
 or


promptly
 resolve
 cognitive
 dissonance,


includes
 the
 self-confirmation
 tendency


of
 all
 conclusions,
 particularly
 express


conclusions,
 and
 with
 a
 special


persistence
 for
 conclusions
 that
 are


hard
 one.
 But
 what
 I'm
 saying
 here
 is


that
 the
 human
 mind
 is
 a
 lot
 like
 the


human
 egg.
 And
 the
 human
 egg
 has
 a
 shut


off
 device.
 when
 sperm
 gets
 in,
 it
 shuts


down
 so
 the
 next
 one
 can't
 get
 in.
 The


human
 mind
 has
 a
 big
 tendency
 of
 the


same
 sort.
 And
 here
 again,
 it
 doesn't


just
 catch
 ordinary
 mortals,
 it
 catches


the
 deans
 of
 physics.
 According
 to
 Max


Plank,
 the
 really
 innovative,
 important


new
 physics
 was
 never
 really
 accepted
 by


the
 old
 guard.
 Instead,
 a
 new
 guard
 came


along
 that
 was
 less
 brain
 blocked
 by
 its


previous
 conclusions.
 And
 if
 Max


Planck's
 crowd
 had
 this
 consistency
 and


commitment
 tendency
 that
 kept
 their
 old


illusions
 intact
 in
 spite
 of


disisconfirming
 evidence,
 you
 can


imagine
 what
 the
 crowd
 that
 you
 and
 I


are
 part
 of
 behaves
 like.


Uh
 and
 of
 course,
 if
 you
 make
 a
 public


disclosure
 of
 your
 conclusion,
 you're


pounding
 it
 in
 to
 your
 own
 head.
 many
 of


these
 students
 that
 are
 screaming
 at
 us,


you
 know,
 they
 aren't
 convincing
 us,
 but


they're
 they're
 forming
 mental
 chains


for
 themselves
 because
 what
 they're


shouting
 out,
 they're
 pounding
 in.
 And


uh
 and
 I
 think
 educational
 institutions


that
 create
 a
 climate
 where
 too
 much
 of


that
 goes
 on
 are
 uh
 in
 a
 fundamental


sense,
 they're
 irresponsible


institutions.
 Uh
 it's
 very
 important


to
 not
 put
 your
 brain
 in
 chains
 too


young
 by
 what
 you
 shout
 out.
 uh
 and
 all


these
 things
 like
 painful
 qualifying
 and


initiation
 rituals
 and
 all
 those


things
 pound
 in
 your
 your
 commitments


and
 your
 ideas
 and
 uh
 the
 Chinese


brainwashing
 system
 which
 was
 for
 war


prisoners
 which
 was
 way
 better
 than


anybody
 else's.
 They
 maneuvered
 people


into
 making
 tiny
 little
 commitments
 and


declarations
 and
 then
 they'd
 slowly


build.
 That
 worked
 way
 better
 than


torture.
 Uh,
 sixth,
 bias
 from
 Pavlovian


association,
 misconstring
 past


correlation
 as
 a
 reliable
 basis
 for


decision-making.
 I
 never
 took
 a
 course


in
 psychology
 or
 economics
 either
 for


that
 matter.
 And
 uh,
 but
 I
 did
 learn


about
 Pavlof
 in
 high
 school
 biology
 and


uh,
 and
 the
 way
 they
 taught
 it,
 you


know,
 so
 the
 dog
 salivated
 when
 the
 bell


rang.
 So
 what,
 you
 know,
 nobody
 made
 the


least
 effort
 to
 tie
 that
 to
 the
 wide


world.
 Well,
 the
 truth
 of
 the
 matter
 is


that
 Pavlovian
 association
 is
 an


enormously
 powerful
 psychological
 force


in
 the
 daily
 life
 of
 all
 of
 us.
 And


indeed
 in
 economics,
 we
 wouldn't
 have


money
 without
 the
 role
 of
 so-called


secondary
 reinforcement,
 which
 is
 a
 pure


psychological


uh
 phenomenon
 demonstrated
 in
 the
 in
 the


laboratory.


Practically,
 I'd
 say
 3/4
 of
 advertising


works
 on
 pure


Pavlov.
 I
 mean,
 think
 how
 association,


pure
 association
 works.
 Take
 Coca-Cola


Company
 where
 we're
 the
 biggest


shareholder.
 They
 want
 to
 be
 associated


with
 every
 wonderful
 image,
 heroics
 in


the
 Olympics,
 wonderful
 music,
 you
 name


it.
 They
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 associated


with
 president's
 funerals
 and
 so
 forth.


When
 have
 you
 seen
 a


Coca-Cola?
 add
 and
 the
 the
 association


really
 works
 and
 all
 these
 psychological


tendencies
 work
 largely
 or
 entirely
 at
 a


on
 a
 subconscious
 level
 which
 is
 which


makes
 them
 very
 insidious.
 Then
 you've


got
 Persian
 messenger
 syndrome.
 The


Persians
 really
 did
 kill
 the
 messenger


who
 brought
 the
 bad
 news.
 You
 think
 that


is
 dead?
 I
 mean
 you
 should
 have
 seen


Bill
 Paley
 in
 his
 last
 20
 years.
 He


didn't
 hear
 one
 damn
 thing
 he
 didn't


want
 to
 hear.
 people
 knew
 that
 it
 that


it
 was
 bad
 for
 the
 messenger
 to
 to
 to


bring
 Bill
 Paley
 things
 he
 didn't
 want


to
 hear.
 Well,
 that
 means
 that
 the


leader
 gets
 in
 an
 cocoon
 of


unreality
 and
 it's
 a
 great
 big


enterprise
 and
 boy
 did
 he
 make
 some
 dumb


decisions
 in
 the
 last
 20
 years
 and
 no


Persian
 me
 messenger
 syndrome
 is
 alive


and
 well.
 When
 I
 saw
 some
 years
 ago
 Arco


and
 Exxon
 arguing
 over
 a
 few
 hundred


millions
 of
 ambiguity
 in
 their
 North


Slope


treaties
 before
 a
 superior
 court
 judge


in
 Texas
 with
 armies
 of
 lawyers
 and


experts
 on
 each
 side,
 this
 is
 a
 mad


hatter's
 tea
 party.
 Two
 engineering


style
 companies
 can't
 resolve
 some


ambiguity
 without
 spending
 tens
 of


millions
 of
 dollars
 in
 some
 Texas


superior
 court.
 In
 my
 opinion,
 what


happens
 is
 that
 nobody
 wants
 to
 bring


the
 bad
 news
 to
 the
 executives
 up
 the


line
 that
 here's
 a
 few
 hundred
 million


dollars
 you
 thought
 you
 had
 that
 you


don't
 and
 it's
 much
 safer
 to
 act
 like


the
 Persian
 messenger
 who
 goes
 away
 to


hide
 rather
 than
 bring
 home
 the
 news
 of


the
 battle


lost
 talking
 about


economics
 you
 get
 a
 very
 interesting


phenomenon
 that
 I've
 seen
 over
 and
 over


again
 in
 a
 long
 life
 you've
 got
 two


products
 suppose
 they're
 complex


technical
 product.
 Now
 you
 think
 under


the
 laws
 of
 economics
 that
 if
 product
 A


costs
 X,
 if
 product


Y


costs
 X
 minus
 something,
 it
 will
 sell


better
 than
 if
 it
 sells
 at
 X
 plus


something.
 But
 that's
 not
 so.
 In
 many


cases,
 when
 you
 raise
 the
 price
 of
 the


alternative
 product,
 it'll
 get
 a
 larger


market
 share
 than
 it
 would
 when
 you
 make


it
 lower
 than
 your
 competitor's
 product.


That's
 because
 the
 bell,
 a
 pavlovian


bell,
 I
 mean,
 ordinarily
 there's
 a


correlation
 between
 price
 and
 value,
 you


have
 an
 information
 inefficiency.
 And
 so


when
 you
 raise
 the
 price,
 the
 sales
 go


up
 relative
 to
 your
 competitor.
 That


happens
 again
 and
 again
 and
 again.
 It's


a
 pure
 Pavlovian
 phenomenon.
 And
 and
 uh


and
 you
 can
 say,
 well,
 the
 economists


have
 figured
 this
 sort
 of
 thing
 out
 when


they
 started
 talking
 about
 information


inefficiencies.
 But
 that
 was
 fairly
 late


in
 economics
 that
 they
 found
 such
 an


obvious
 thing.
 And
 of
 course,
 most
 of


them
 don't
 ask
 what
 causes
 the


information
 inefficiencies.
 Well,
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 causes
 it
 is
 pure
 old


Babof
 and
 his


dog.
 Now,
 you
 got
 bias
 from
 scannerian


association,
 operant
 conditioning,
 you


know,
 where
 you
 give
 the
 dog
 a
 reward


and
 uh
 and


and
 pound
 in
 the
 behavior
 that
 uh


preceded
 the
 dogs
 getting
 the
 award.
 And


of
 course,
 Skinner
 was
 able
 to
 create


superstitious
 pigeons
 by
 having
 rewards


come,
 you
 know,
 by
 accident
 with
 certain


occurrences.
 And
 of
 course,
 we
 all
 know


people
 who
 are
 the
 human
 equivalents
 of


superstitious
 pigeons.
 That's
 a
 very


powerful
 phenomenon.
 And
 of
 course,


operant
 conditioning
 really
 works.
 I


mean,
 the
 people
 in
 the
 center
 who
 think


that
 operant
 conditioning
 is
 is


important
 are
 are
 are
 very
 much
 right.


It's
 just
 that
 the
 Skinner
 overdid
 it
 a


little.


where
 you
 see
 in
 business
 just
 perfectly


horrible
 results
 from


psychological
 psychologically


rooted


tendencies
 is
 in
 accounting.
 If
 you
 take


Westinghouse
 which
 blew
 what
 2
 or3


billion
 dollars
 pre-tax
 at
 least
 loaning


developers
 to
 build
 hotels
 and
 virtually


100%
 loans.
 Now,
 you
 say
 any
 idiot
 knows


that
 there's
 one
 thing
 you
 don't
 like,


it's
 a
 developer.
 Another
 you
 don't


like,
 it's
 a
 hotel.
 And
 to
 make
 a
 100%


loan
 to
 a
 developer
 who's
 going
 to
 build


a


hotel,
 but
 but
 this
 guy,
 he
 probably
 was


an
 engineer
 or
 something.
 And
 he
 didn't


take
 psychology
 anymore,
 and
 I
 did.
 And


he
 got
 out
 there
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 these


select
 salesmen
 operating
 under
 their


version
 of
 incentive
 caused
 bias
 where


any
 damn
 way
 of
 getting
 Westinghouse
 to


do
 what
 was
 considered
 normal
 business.


and
 they
 just
 blew
 the
 that
 would
 never


have
 been
 possible
 if
 the
 accounting


system
 hadn't
 been
 such
 that
 for
 the


initial
 phase
 of
 every
 transaction
 it


showed
 wonderful
 financial


results.
 So
 people
 who
 have
 loose


accounting
 standards
 are
 just
 inviting


perfectly
 horrible
 behavior
 in
 other


people.
 Uh
 and
 it's
 a
 sin.
 It's
 an


absolute
 sin
 to
 if
 you
 carried
 bushel


baskets
 full
 of
 money
 through
 the
 ghetto


and
 made
 them
 made
 it
 easy
 to
 steal
 that


would
 be
 a
 considerable
 human
 sin


because
 you'd
 be
 causing
 a
 lot
 of
 bad


behavior
 and
 the
 bad
 behavior
 would


spread.
 Similarly,
 an
 institution
 that


gets
 sloppy
 accounting


uh
 commits
 a
 real
 human
 sin
 and
 it's


also
 a
 dumb
 way
 to
 do
 business
 as


Westinghouse
 has
 so
 wonderfully
 proved.


Oddly
 enough,
 nobody
 mentions,
 at least


nobody
 I've
 seen,
 what
 happened
 with
 Joe


Jet
 and
 Ker
 Peabody.
 The
 truth
 of
 the


matter
 is
 the
 accounting
 system
 was
 such


that
 by
 punching
 a
 few
 buttons,
 the
 Joe


Jets
 of
 the
 world
 could
 show
 profits
 and


profits
 that
 showed
 up
 in
 things
 that


resulted
 in
 rewards
 and
 esteem
 and
 every


other
 thing
 that
 human
 beings.
 Well,
 the


Joe
 Jets
 are
 always
 with
 us
 and
 they're


not
 really
 to
 blame
 in
 my
 judgment
 at


least.
 But
 that
 bastard
 who
 who
 created


that
 foolish
 accounting
 system
 who
 so


far
 as
 I
 know
 has
 not
 been
 played
 alive


ought
 to


be.
 Seventh
 bias
 from


reciprocation
 tendency
 including
 the


tendency
 of
 one
 in
 a
 role
 to
 act
 as


other
 persons


expect.
 Well,
 here


again,
 Sealini
 does
 a
 magnificent
 job
 at


this.
 And
 you're
 all
 going
 to
 be
 given
 a


copy
 of
 Sealini's
 book.
 And
 if
 you
 have


half
 as
 much
 sense
 as
 I
 think
 you
 do,


you
 will
 immediately
 order
 copies
 for


all
 of
 your
 children
 and
 several
 of
 your


friends.
 You
 will
 never
 make
 a
 better


investment.
 It
 is
 so
 easy
 to
 be
 a
 pathy


for
 what
 he
 calls
 the
 compliance


practitioners
 of
 this
 life.
 And
 uh
 but


at
 any
 rate,
 reciprocation
 tendency
 is
 a


very
 very
 powerful
 phenomenon.
 And
 Seal


Denny
 demonstrated
 this
 by
 running


around
 a
 campus
 and
 he
 asked
 people
 to


to
 take
 juvenile


delinquents
 to
 the
 zoo
 and
 it
 was
 a


campus.
 And
 so
 one
 and
 six
 actually


agreed
 to
 do
 it.
 And


uh
 and
 after
 he'd
 accumulated
 the


statistical
 output,
 he
 went
 around
 on


the
 same
 campus
 and
 he
 asked
 other


people.
 He
 said,
 "Gee,
 would
 you
 devote


two
 afternoons
 a
 week
 to
 taking
 juvenile


delinquents
 somewhere
 and
 suffering


greatly
 yourself
 to
 help
 them?"
 And


there
 he
 got
 100%
 of
 the
 people
 to
 say


no.
 But
 after
 he
 made
 the
 first
 request,


he
 backed
 off
 a
 little.
 He
 said, "Well,


would
 you
 at least
 take
 them
 to
 the
 zoo


one
 afternoon?"
 He
 raised
 the
 compliance


rate
 from
 a
 third
 to
 a
 half.
 You
 got


three
 times
 the
 success
 by
 just
 going


through
 the


little
 ask
 for
 a
 lot
 and
 back
 off.
 Now,


if
 the
 human
 mind
 on
 a
 subconscious


level
 can
 be
 manipulated
 that
 way
 and


you
 don't
 know


it,
 well,
 I
 always
 use
 the
 phrase
 you're


like
 a
 one-legged
 man
 in
 an
 asskicking


contest.
 I
 mean,
 you


are
 I
 mean,
 you
 are
 really
 giving
 a
 lot


of
 quarter
 to
 the
 external
 world
 that


you
 you
 you
 can't
 afford
 to
 give.


and
 uh
 on
 this
 so-called
 role
 theory


where
 you
 tend
 to
 act
 in
 the
 way
 that


other
 people
 expect.
 That's


reciprocation
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 way


society
 is
 organized.
 And
 a
 guy
 named


Zimardo
 had
 people
 at
 Stanford
 divide


into
 two
 pieces.
 One
 were
 the
 guards
 and


the
 other
 were
 the
 prisoners.
 And
 they


started
 acting
 out
 roles
 as
 people


expected.
 He
 had
 to
 stop
 the
 experiment


after
 about
 5
 days.
 He
 was
 getting
 into


human
 misery
 and
 breakdown
 and


pathological
 behavior.
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 it


was
 it
 was


awesome.


However,
 Timardo
 is
 greatly


misinterpreted.
 It's
 not
 just


reciprocation
 tendency
 and
 role
 theory


that
 caused
 that.
 It's
 consistency
 and


commitment
 tendency.
 Each
 person
 as
 he


acted
 as
 a
 guard
 or
 a
 prisoner,
 the


action
 itself
 was
 pounding


in
 the
 idea.
 Wherever
 you
 turn,
 this


consistency
 and
 commitment
 tendency
 is


is
 affecting
 you.
 In
 other
 words,
 what


you
 think
 may
 change
 what
 you
 do.
 But


perhaps
 even
 more
 important,
 what
 you
 do


will
 change
 what
 you
 think.
 And
 you
 can


say
 everybody
 knows
 that.
 I
 want
 to
 tell


you
 I
 didn't
 know
 it
 well
 enough
 early


enough.
 Eight.
 Now
 this
 is
 a
 laalapalooa


and
 Henry
 Kaufman
 wisely
 talked
 about


this.
 bias
 from
 over
 influence
 by
 social


proof
 that
 is
 the
 conclusions
 of
 others


particularly
 under
 conditions
 of
 natural


uncertainty
 and


stress.
 And
 here
 one
 of the
 cases
 the


psychologists
 use
 is
 Kitty
 Genevy
 where


all
 these
 people
 I
 don't know
 50
 60
 70


of
 them
 just
 sort
 of
 sat
 and
 did
 nothing


while
 she
 was
 slowly


murdered.
 Now
 one
 of
 the
 explanations
 is


everybody
 looked
 at
 everybody
 else
 and


nobody
 else
 was
 doing
 anything.
 And
 so


there's
 automatic
 social
 proof
 that
 the


right
 thing
 to
 do
 is
 nothing.
 That's
 not


a
 good
 enough
 explanation
 for
 Kitty


Genevese
 in
 my
 judgment.
 That's
 only


part
 of
 it.
 There
 are
 microeconomic


ideas
 and
 game
 loss
 ratios
 and
 so
 forth


that
 also
 come
 into
 play.
 I
 think
 time


and
 time
 again
 in
 reality
 psychological


notions
 and
 economic
 notions
 interplay.


And
 the
 man
 who
 doesn't
 understand
 both


is
 a
 damn
 fool.


big
 shot
 businessmen
 get
 into
 these


waves
 of
 social
 proof.
 Do
 you
 remember


some
 years
 ago
 when
 one
 oil
 company


bought
 a
 fertilizer
 company
 and
 every


other
 major
 oil
 company
 practically
 ran


out
 and
 bought
 a
 fertilizer
 company
 and


there
 was
 no
 more
 damn
 reason
 for
 all


these
 oil
 companies
 to
 buy
 fertilizer


companies
 but
 they
 didn't
 know
 exactly


what
 to
 do
 and
 if
 Exxon
 was
 doing
 it
 was


good
 enough
 for
 mobile
 or
 vice
 versa
 and


of
 course
 the
 I
 think
 they're
 all
 gone


now.
 It's
 it
 was
 a
 total
 disaster.


Now
 let's
 talk
 about
 efficient
 market


theory.
 A
 wonderful
 economic
 doctrine


that
 had
 a
 long
 vogue
 in
 spite
 of
 the


experience
 of
 Berkshire
 Hathaway.
 In


fact,
 one
 of
 the
 economists
 who
 won
 he


shared
 a
 Nobel
 Prize
 and
 as
 he
 looked
 at


Berkshire
 Hathaway
 year
 after
 year
 which


people
 would
 throw
 in
 his
 face
 saying


maybe
 the
 market
 isn't
 quite
 as


efficient
 as
 you
 think.
 He
 said
 well


it's
 a
 two
 sigma
 event.
 Then
 he
 said
 we


were
 a
 three
 sigma
 event
 and
 then
 he


said
 we
 were
 a
 four
 sigma
 event.
 and
 he


finally
 got
 up
 to
 six
 sigas.
 Better
 to


add
 a
 sigma
 than
 change
 a
 theory
 just


because
 the
 evidence
 comes
 in


differently.
 And
 of
 course
 when
 this


share
 of
 a
 Nobel
 prize
 went
 in
 the
 money


management
 himself,
 he
 sank
 like
 a


stone.
 If
 you
 if
 you
 think


about
 the
 doctrines
 I've
 talked
 about,


namely
 one,
 the
 power
 of
 reinforcement.


After
 all,
 you
 do
 something
 and
 the


market
 goes
 up
 and
 you
 get
 paid
 and


rewarded
 and
 applauded
 and
 what
 have


you.
 You're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 refor


reinforcement.
 If
 you
 make
 a
 bet
 in
 a


market
 and
 the
 market
 goes
 with
 you.


Also,
 there's
 social


proof.
 I
 mean,
 the
 the
 prices
 in
 the


market
 are
 the
 ultimate
 form
 of
 social


proof
 reflecting
 what
 other
 people


think.
 And
 so,
 the
 combination
 is
 very


powerful.
 Why
 would
 you
 expect
 general


market
 levels
 to
 always
 be
 totally


efficient?
 say
 even
 in
 1973
 4
 at
 the
 pit


or
 in


1972
 or
 whatever
 it
 was
 when
 the
 nifty50


were
 in
 their
 heyday.


If
 these
 psychological
 notions
 are


correct,
 you
 would
 affect
 you
 would


expect
 some
 waves
 of


irrationality


which
 which
 carry
 general
 levels
 to
 to


uh
 to


um
 so
 they're
 inconsistent
 with
 with


with
 reason.


Nine,
 what
 made
 these
 economists
 love


the
 efficient
 market
 theory
 is
 the
 math


was
 so
 elegant.
 And
 after
 all,
 math
 was


what
 they'd
 learned
 to
 do.
 The
 man
 with


a
 hammer,
 every
 problem
 tends
 to
 look


pretty
 much
 like
 a
 nail.
 The
 alternative


truth
 was
 a
 little
 messy,
 and
 they'd


forgotten
 the
 great
 economist
 Canes,


whom
 I
 think
 said,
 "Better
 to
 be
 roughly


right
 than
 precisely


wrong."
 Nine,
 biased
 from
 contrastcaused


distortions
 of
 sensation,
 perception,


and
 cognition.
 Here,
 the
 great


experiment
 that
 Sealini
 does
 in
 his


class,
 he
 takes
 three
 buckets
 of
 water.


One's
 hot,
 one's
 cold,
 and
 one's
 room


temperature.
 He
 has
 the
 student
 stick


his
 left
 hand
 in
 the
 hot
 water
 and
 his


right
 hand
 in
 the
 cold
 water.
 Then
 he


has
 them
 remove
 the
 hands
 and
 put
 them


both
 in
 the
 room
 temperature
 bucket.
 And


of
 course,
 with
 both
 hands
 in
 the
 same


bucket
 of
 water,
 one
 seems
 hot,
 the


other
 seems
 cold.
 Because
 the
 sensation


apparatus
 of
 man
 is
 over
 influenced
 by


contrast.
 It
 has
 no
 absolute
 scale.
 It's


got
 a
 contrast
 scale
 in
 it.
 And
 it's
 a


scale
 with
 quantum
 effects
 in
 it,
 too.


It
 takes
 a
 certain
 percentage
 change


before
 it's


noticed.
 Maybe
 you've
 had
 an
 magician


remove
 your
 watch.
 I
 certainly
 have,


without
 your
 noticing
 it.
 It's
 the
 same


thing.
 He's
 taking
 advantage
 of


your
 of
 your
 of
 contrast
 type
 troubles


in
 your
 sensory
 apparatus.
 But
 here,
 the


great
 truth
 is
 that
 cognition
 mimics


sensation.
 And
 the
 cognition


manipulators
 mimic
 the
 watch
 removing


magician.
 In
 other
 words,
 people
 are


manipulating
 you
 all
 day
 long
 on
 this


contrast
 phenomenon.
 Sealed
 any
 sites


the
 case
 of
 the
 real
 estate
 broker
 and


you
 got
 the
 rube
 that's
 been
 transferred


into
 your
 town
 and
 the
 first
 thing
 you


do
 is
 you
 take
 the
 rube
 out
 to
 two
 of


the
 most
 awful
 overpriced
 houses
 you've


ever
 seen.
 And
 then
 you
 take
 the
 robe
 to


some
 moderately
 overpriced
 house
 and


then
 you
 stick
 them.
 And
 it
 it
 works


pretty
 well,
 which
 is
 why
 the
 real


estate
 salesman
 do
 it.
 And
 uh
 it's


always
 going
 to
 work.
 And
 the
 accidents


of
 life
 can
 can
 do
 this
 to
 you
 and
 it


can
 ruin
 your
 life.
 In
 my
 generation,


when
 women
 lived
 at
 home
 until
 they
 got


married,
 I
 saw
 some
 perfectly
 terrible


marriages
 made
 by
 by
 highly
 desirable


women
 because
 they
 lived
 in
 terrible


homes.


And
 uh
 and
 I've
 seen
 some
 terrible


second
 marriages
 which
 were
 made
 because


there
 were
 slight
 improvements
 over
 an


even
 worse
 first


marriage.
 And
 you
 think
 you're
 immune


from
 these
 things
 and
 you
 laugh
 and
 I


want
 to
 tell
 you
 you


aren't.
 And
 the


uh
 my
 favorite
 analogy
 I
 can't
 vouch
 for


the
 accuracy
 of.
 I
 have
 this
 worthless


friend
 I
 like
 to
 play
 bridge
 with
 and


he's
 a
 total
 intellectual
 amateur
 that


lives
 on
 inherited
 money.
 But
 he
 told
 me


once
 something
 I
 really
 enjoyed
 hearing.


He
 said,
 "Charlie,"
 he
 says,
 "If
 you


throw
 a
 frog
 into
 very
 hot
 water,
 the


frog
 will
 jump
 out.
 But
 if
 you
 put
 the


frog
 in
 room
 temperature
 water
 and
 just


slowly
 heat
 the
 water
 up,
 the
 frog
 will


die
 there."
 Now,
 I
 don't
 know
 whether


that's
 true
 about
 a
 frog,
 but
 it's
 sure


as
 hell
 true
 about
 many
 of
 the


businessmen
 I
 know.
 And
 there
 again
 it


is


the
 it
 is
 the
 contrast
 phenomenon.
 These


are
 hot
 shot
 high-powered
 people.
 I
 mean


these
 are


not
 fools.
 If
 it
 comes
 to
 you
 in
 small


pieces
 you're
 likely
 to
 miss.
 So
 you


have
 to
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 a
 person


of
 good
 judgment,
 you
 have
 to
 do


something
 about
 this
 warp
 in
 your
 head


where
 it's
 so
 misled
 by
 by
 mere
 contrast


bias
 from
 over
 influence
 by
 authority.


Well,
 here
 the
 Mgrim
 experiment
 as
 it's


caused,
 I
 think
 there
 have
 been
 1600


psychological
 papers
 written
 about
 Mgrim


and
 he
 had
 a
 person
 posing
 as
 an


authority
 figure


uh
 trick


ordinary
 people
 into
 giving
 what
 they


had
 every
 reason
 to
 expect
 was
 heavy


torture
 by
 electric
 shock
 to
 perfectly


innocent
 fellow
 citizens.


And
 the
 experiment
 has
 been
 he
 was


trying
 to
 show
 that
 why
 Hitler
 succeeded


and
 a
 few
 other
 things
 and
 uh
 and
 uh
 so


this
 really
 caught
 the
 fancy
 of
 the


world
 partly
 it's
 so
 politically
 correct


and
 uh
 and


uh
 and


uh
 over
 influenced
 by
 authority
 has


another
 very
 you
 this
 will
 you'll
 like


this
 one.
 You
 got
 a
 pilot
 and
 a


co-pilot.
 The
 pilot
 is
 the
 authority


figure.


They
 don't
 do
 this
 in
 airplanes,
 but


they've
 done
 it
 in
 simulators.
 They
 have


the
 pilot
 do


something
 where
 the
 co-pilot,
 who's
 been


trained
 in
 simulators
 a
 long
 time,
 he


knows
 he's
 not
 to
 allow
 the
 plane
 to


crash.
 They
 have
 the
 pilot
 to
 do


something
 where
 an
 idiot
 co-pilot
 would


know
 the
 plane
 was
 going
 to
 crash,
 but


the
 pilot's
 doing
 it
 and
 the
 co-pilot
 is


sitting
 there
 and
 the
 pilot
 is
 the


authority


figure.
 25%
 of
 the
 time
 the
 plane


crashes.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 a
 very


powerful


psychological


tendency.
 It's
 not
 quite
 as
 powerful
 as


some
 people
 think,
 and
 I'll
 get
 to
 that


later.
 11.
 Bias
 from
 deprival
 super


reaction
 syndrome,
 including
 bias
 caused


by
 present
 or
 threatened
 scarcity,


including
 threatened
 removal
 of


something
 almost
 possessed
 but
 never


possessed.
 Here
 I
 took
 the
 munger
 dog.


Lovely,
 harmless
 dog.
 The
 one
 way,
 the


only
 way
 to
 get
 that
 dog
 to
 bite
 you
 was


to
 try
 and
 take
 something
 out
 of
 its


mouth
 after
 it
 was
 already
 there.
 And


any
 of
 you
 who
 have
 tried
 to
 do


takeaways
 and
 labor
 negotiations
 will


know
 that
 a
 human
 version
 of
 that
 dog
 is


there
 in
 all
 of
 us.
 And
 uh
 I
 have
 a


neighbor
 on
 a
 neighbor,
 a
 predecessor
 on


a
 little
 island
 where
 I
 have
 a
 house.


and
 his
 next
 door
 neighbor
 put
 a
 little


pine
 tree
 in
 that
 was
 about
 3
 feet
 high


and
 it
 turned
 his
 180
 degree
 view
 of
 the


harbor
 into
 179
 and
 3/4.
 Well,
 they
 had


a
 blood
 feud
 like
 the
 Hatfields
 and
 Aoys


and
 it
 went
 on
 and
 on
 and
 on
 and
 I
 mean


people
 are
 really
 crazy
 about
 minor


decrements
 down
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 if
 you


act
 on
 them
 you
 get
 into
 reciprocation


tendency
 because
 you
 don't
 just


reciprocate
 affection,
 you
 reciprocate


animosity
 and
 the
 whole
 thing
 can


escalate.
 And
 so
 huge
 insanities
 can


come
 from
 from
 just
 subconsciously


overweighing
 the
 importance
 of
 what


you're
 losing
 or
 almost
 getting
 and
 not


getting.
 And
 uh
 the
 extreme
 business


case
 here
 was
 New


Coke.
 Now
 Coca-Cola
 has
 the
 most


valuable
 trademark
 in
 the


world.
 We're
 the
 major
 shareholder.
 I


mean
 we
 I
 think
 we
 understand
 that


trademark.
 KO
 has
 armies
 of
 brilliant


engineers,
 lawyers,
 psychologists,


advertising
 executives
 and
 so
 forth.
 and


they
 had
 a
 trademark
 on
 a


flavor
 and
 they'd
 spent
 better
 part
 of
 a


hundred
 years
 getting
 people
 to
 believe


that
 trademark
 had
 all
 these
 intangible


values
 too
 and
 people
 associated
 it
 with


a
 flavor
 and
 so
 they
 were
 going
 to
 tell


people
 not
 that
 it
 was
 improved
 because


you
 can't
 improve
 a
 flavor
 flavor
 is
 a


matter
 of
 taste
 I
 mean
 you
 may
 improve


improve
 a
 detergent
 or
 something
 but


telling
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 a
 major


change
 in
 a
 in
 a
 flavor


I
 mean,
 so
 they
 got
 this
 huge
 deprival


super
 reaction
 syndrome.
 Pepsi
 was


within
 weeks
 of
 coming
 out
 with
 old
 Coke


in
 a
 Pepsi
 bottle,
 which
 would
 have
 been


the
 biggest
 fiasco
 in
 modern
 times.


Perfect
 pl
 perfect
 insanity.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 both
 and
 Kio
 are
 just
 wonderful


about
 it.
 I
 mean,
 they
 just
 joke.
 coming


down.
 Kio
 always
 says
 I
 must
 have
 been


away
 on
 vacation.
 He
 participated
 in


every
 single
 He's
 a
 wonderful
 guy
 and
 by


the
 way
 go
 is
 a
 wonderful
 smart
 guy
 an


engineer.
 Smart
 people
 make
 these


terrible
 boners.
 How
 can
 you
 not


understand
 deprival
 suk
 super
 reaction


syndrome
 but


people
 I
 mean
 people
 do
 not
 react


symmetrically
 to
 loss
 and
 gain.
 Now


maybe
 you
 have
 a
 great
 bridge
 player


like
 Zehauser
 does,
 but
 that's
 a
 trained


response.
 Uh
 ordinary


people


subconsciously
 affected
 by
 their
 inborn


tendencies.
 Uh
 bias
 from
 envy,
 jealousy.


Well,
 envy,
 jealousy
 made
 what?
 Two
 out


of
 the
 ten
 commandments.
 Those
 of
 you


who
 have
 raised
 siblings,
 you
 know
 about


or
 tried
 to
 run
 a
 law
 firm
 or
 investment


bank
 or
 even
 a
 faculty.
 I've
 heard


Warren
 say
 a
 half
 a
 dozen
 times,
 it's


not
 greed
 that
 drives
 the
 world,
 but


envy.
 Here
 again,
 you
 go
 through
 the


psychology
 survey
 courses.
 And
 you
 go
 to


the
 index,
 envy,
 jealousy,
 thousandpage


book.
 It's


blank.
 There's
 some
 blind
 spots
 in


academia,
 but
 it's
 an
 enormously


powerful
 uh
 thing
 and
 it
 operates
 to
 a


considerable
 extent
 on
 a
 subconscious


level.
 And
 anybody
 who
 doesn't


understand
 it
 is
 is


uh
 is
 taking
 on
 defects
 he
 shouldn't


have.
 Bias
 from
 chemical
 dependency.


Well,
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 that.


We've
 all
 seen
 so
 much
 of
 it.
 But
 it's


interesting
 how
 it
 always
 causes
 moral


breakdown
 if
 there's


any
 need
 and
 uh
 and
 it
 always
 involves


massive
 denial.
 So
 it's
 just
 it


aggravates
 what
 we
 talked
 about
 earlier


in
 the
 aviator
 case,
 the
 tendency
 to


distort
 reality
 so
 that
 it's


endurable.
 Uh
 bias
 from
 misgambling


compulsion.
 Well,
 here
 Skinner
 made
 the


only
 explanation
 you'll
 find
 in
 the


standard
 psychology
 survey
 course.
 He
 of


course
 created
 a
 variable


reinforcement
 rate
 for
 his
 pigeons
 and


his
 mice
 and
 he
 found
 that
 that
 would


pound
 in
 the
 behavior
 better
 than
 any


other
 reinforcement
 pattern.
 And
 he


says,
 "Aha,
 I've
 explained
 why
 gambling


is
 such
 a
 powerful
 addictive
 force
 in
 a


civilization.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 to
 a
 very


considerable
 extent
 true."
 But
 being


Skinner,
 he
 seemed
 to
 think
 that
 was
 the


only
 explanation.
 But
 the
 truth
 of
 the


matter
 is
 that
 the
 devisers
 of
 these


modern
 machines
 and
 techniques
 know
 a


lot
 of
 things
 that
 Skinner
 didn't
 know.


For
 instance,
 a
 lottery.
 You
 have
 a


lottery
 where
 you
 get
 your
 number


by
 lot
 and
 then
 somebody
 draws
 a
 number


by
 lot.
 It
 gets
 lousy
 play.
 You
 get
 a


lottery
 where
 people
 get
 to
 pick
 their


number,
 get
 big
 play.
 Again,
 it's
 this


consistency
 and
 commitment
 thing.
 People


think
 that
 if
 they've
 committed
 to
 it,


it
 has
 to
 be
 good.
 And
 the
 minute
 they


picked
 it
 themselves,
 it
 gets
 an
 extra


validity.
 After
 all,
 they
 thought
 it
 and


they
 acted
 on
 it.
 And
 uh
 then
 if
 you


take
 slot
 machines,
 you
 get
 bar
 bar


lemon.
 It
 happens
 again
 and
 again
 and


again.
 You
 get
 all
 these
 near


misses.
 Well,
 that's
 deprival
 super


reaction
 syndrome.
 And
 boy,
 do
 the


people
 who
 who
 create
 the
 machines


understand
 human


psychology.
 And
 if
 you
 got
 for
 the
 high


IQ
 crowd,
 they've
 got
 poker
 machines


where
 you
 make


choices.
 So
 you
 can
 play
 blackjack,
 so


to
 speak,
 with
 the
 machine.
 It's


wonderful
 what
 we've
 done
 with
 our


computers
 to
 ruin
 a
 civilization.
 And
 uh


but
 anyway,
 misgambling
 compulsion
 is
 a


very
 very
 powerful
 and
 important
 thing.


Look
 at
 what's
 happening
 to
 our
 country.


every
 Indian
 reservation,
 every
 river


town
 and
 uh
 and
 look
 at
 the
 people
 who


were
 ruined
 but
 by
 it
 with
 the
 aid
 of


their
 stock
 brokers
 and
 others.
 And


uh
 again,
 if
 you
 look
 in
 the
 in
 the


standard
 textbook
 of
 psychology,
 you'll


find
 practically
 nothing
 on
 it
 except


maybe
 one
 sentence
 talking
 about


Skanner's


rats.
 That
 is
 not
 an
 adequate
 coverage


of
 the


subject.
 bias
 from
 liking
 distortion,


including
 the
 tendency
 to
 especially


like
 oneself,
 one's
 own
 kind,
 and
 one's


own
 idea
 structures,
 and
 the
 tendency
 to


be
 especially
 susceptible
 to
 being


misled
 by
 someone
 liked.
 Disliking


distortion,
 bias
 from
 that,
 the


reciprocal
 of
 liking
 distortion,
 and
 the


tendency
 not
 to
 learn
 appropriately
 from


someone
 disliked.
 Well,
 here
 again,


we've


got
 hugely
 powerful
 tendencies.
 And
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 wars
 in
 part
 of
 the


Harvard
 Law
 School
 as
 we
 sit
 here,
 you


can
 see
 that
 very
 brilliant
 people
 get


into
 this
 almost
 pathological
 behavior.


And
 uh
 these
 are
 very
 very
 powerful


basic
 subconscious
 psychological


tendencies
 or
 at least
 partly


subconscious.
 Now
 let's
 get
 back
 to
 BF


Skinner.
 Man
 with
 a
 hammer
 syndrome


revisited.
 Why
 is
 man
 with
 the
 hammer


syndrome
 always
 present?
 Well,
 if
 you


stop
 to
 think
 about
 it,
 it's
 caused


bias.
 His
 professional
 reputation
 is
 all


tied
 up
 with
 what
 he
 knows.
 He
 likes


himself
 and
 he
 likes
 his
 own
 ideas
 and


uh
 and
 he's
 expressed
 them
 to
 other


people.
 Consistency
 and
 commitment


tendency.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got
 four
 or
 five


of
 these
 elementary
 psychological


tendencies


combining
 to
 create
 this
 man
 with
 a


hammer
 syndrome.


Once
 you


realize
 that
 that
 you
 can't
 really
 buy


your
 thinking


done,
 partly
 you
 can,
 but
 largely
 you


can't
 in
 this
 world.
 You
 have
 learned
 a


lesson
 that's
 very
 useful
 in


life.
 George
 Bernard
 Shaw
 said
 and
 had
 a


character
 say
 in
 the
 doctor's
 dilemma,


in
 the
 last
 analysis,
 every
 profession


is
 a
 conspiracy
 against
 the
 ley.
 But
 he


didn't
 have
 it
 quite
 right
 because
 it


isn't
 so
 much
 conspiracy
 as
 it
 is
 a


subconscious
 psychological
 tendency.
 The


guy
 tells
 you
 what
 is
 good
 for
 him.
 He


doesn't
 recognize
 that
 he's
 doing


anything
 wrong
 any
 more
 than
 that
 doctor


did
 when
 he
 was
 pulling
 out
 all
 those


normal
 gallbladders.
 And
 uh
 he
 believes


that
 his
 own
 idea
 structures
 will
 cure


cancer.
 and
 he
 believes
 that
 that
 uh


that
 the
 guardian
 that
 the
 demons
 that


he's
 the
 guardian
 against
 are
 the


biggest
 demons
 and
 the
 most
 important


ones
 and
 in
 fact
 they
 may
 be
 very
 small


demons
 compared
 to
 the
 demons
 that
 you


face.
 So
 you're
 getting
 your
 advice
 in


this
 world
 from
 your
 paid
 adviser
 with


this
 huge
 load
 of
 ghastly


bias
 and
 woe
 to
 you
 there
 only
 two
 ways


to
 handle
 it.
 You
 can
 hire
 your
 adviser


and
 then
 just
 apply
 a
 windage
 factor


like
 I
 used
 to
 do
 when
 I
 was
 a
 rifle


shooter.
 I
 just
 adjust
 for
 so
 many
 miles


an
 hour
 of
 wind
 and
 or
 you


can
 learn
 the
 basic
 elements
 of
 your


advisor's
 trade.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 learn


very
 much
 by
 the
 way
 because
 you
 learn


just
 a
 little
 and
 you
 can
 make
 him


explain
 why
 he's


right.
 And
 those
 two
 tendencies
 will


take
 part
 of
 the
 warp
 out
 of
 the


thinking
 you've
 tried
 to
 hire
 done.
 By


and
 large,
 it
 works
 terribly.
 I
 have


never
 seen
 a
 management
 consultants


report
 in
 my
 long
 life
 that
 didn't
 end


with
 the
 following
 paragraph.
 What
 this


situation
 really
 needs
 is
 more


management


consulting.
 Never
 once.
 I
 always
 turn
 to


the
 last


page.
 Of
 course,
 Berway
 doesn't
 hire


them.


I
 only
 do
 this
 in
 sort
 of
 a
 voyeristic


basis.
 Sometimes
 I'm
 in
 a
 nonprofit


where
 some
 idiot
 hires


one
 17.


bias
 from
 the
 non-mathematical
 nature
 of


the
 human
 brain
 and
 its
 natural
 state
 as


it
 deals
 with
 probabilities
 employing


crude
 huristics
 and
 is
 often
 misled
 by


mere
 contrast,
 a
 tendency
 to
 overweigh


conveniently
 available
 information
 and


other
 psychologically
 rooted
 misthinking


tendencies
 on
 this
 list
 when
 the
 brain


should
 be
 using
 the
 simple
 probability


mathematics
 of
 Fairmat
 and
 Pascal


applied
 to
 all
 reasonably
 obtainable
 and


correctly
 weighted
 items
 of
 information


that
 are
 of
 value
 in
 predicting


outcomes.
 The
 right
 way
 to
 think
 is
 the


way
 Zack
 Hower
 plays
 bridge.
 It's
 just


that


simple.
 And
 your
 brain
 doesn't
 naturally


know
 how
 to
 think
 the
 way
 Zack
 Hower


knows
 how
 to
 play
 bridge.


Now
 you
 notice
 I
 put
 in
 that


availability
 thing
 and
 there
 I'm


mimicking
 some
 very
 eminent


psychologists
 Don
 Manag
 I
 hope
 I


pronounced
 that
 right
 and
 Diverski
 who


who
 who
 raised
 the
 idea
 of
 availability


to
 a
 whole
 heruristic
 of


misjudgment
 and
 you
 know
 they
 are
 very


substantially
 right
 I
 mean
 ask
 the


Coca-Cola
 company
 which
 has
 raised


availability
 to
 a
 secular


religion
 if
 availability
 changes


behavior
 you
 will
 drink
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 lot


more
 coke
 if
 it's
 always
 available.
 I


mean,
 availability
 does
 change
 behavior


and


cognition.
 Nonetheless,
 even
 though
 I


recognize
 that
 and
 applaud
 Tverki
 and


Conman,
 I
 don't
 like
 it
 for
 my
 personal


system
 except
 as
 part
 of
 a
 greater


subsystem,
 which
 is
 you
 got
 to
 think
 the


way
 Zackauser
 plays
 the
 bridge.
 It
 isn't


just
 the
 lack
 of
 availability
 that

 ]
distorts
 your
 judgment.
 All
 the
 things


on
 this
 list


distort
 judgment
 and
 I
 want
 to
 train


myself
 to
 kind
 of
 mentally
 run
 down
 the


list
 instead
 of
 just
 jumping
 on


availability.
 So
 that's
 why
 I
 state
 it


the
 way
 I
 do.
 In
 a
 sense,
 these


psychological
 tendencies
 make
 things


unavailable
 because
 if
 you
 quickly
 jump


to
 one
 thing
 and
 then
 because
 you've


jumped
 to
 it,
 the
 the
 consistency
 and


commitment
 tendency
 makes
 you
 lock


in.
 Boom.
 That's
 error
 number


one.
 or
 if
 something
 is
 very
 vivid,


which
 I'm
 going
 to
 come
 to
 next,
 that


will
 really
 pound
 in.
 And
 the
 reason


that
 the
 thing
 that
 really
 matters
 is


now
 unavailable.
 And
 what's
 extra
 vivid


wins
 is
 I
 mean


it
 the
 the
 extra
 vividness
 creates
 the


unavailability.


So
 I
 think
 it's
 much
 better
 to
 have
 a


whole
 list
 things
 that
 that
 cause
 you
 to


be
 less
 like
 Zehouser
 than
 it
 is
 just
 to


jump
 on
 one


factor.
 Uh


here
 I
 think
 we
 should
 discuss
 John


Goodfriend.
 This
 is
 a
 very
 interesting


human
 example
 which
 will
 be
 taught
 in


every
 decent
 professional
 school
 for
 at


least
 a
 full
 generation.


Good
 friend
 has
 a
 trusted


employee


and
 it
 comes
 to


light,
 not
 through
 confession,
 but
 by


accident,
 that
 the
 trusted
 employee
 has


lied
 like
 hell
 to
 the
 government
 and


manipulated
 the
 accounting
 system.
 And


it
 was
 really
 equivalent
 to
 forgery.
 and


uh
 and


uh
 and
 uh
 the
 man
 immediately
 says,


"I've
 never
 done
 it
 before.
 I'll
 never


do
 it
 again."
 It
 was
 an
 isolated


example.
 And
 of
 course,
 it
 was
 obvious


that
 he
 wasn't
 trying
 to
 he
 was
 trying


to
 help
 the
 government
 as
 well
 as


himself
 cuz
 he
 thought
 the
 government


had
 been
 dumb
 enough
 to
 pass
 a
 a
 rule


that
 he'd
 spoken
 against.
 And
 after
 all,


if
 a
 government's
 not
 going
 to
 pay


attention
 to
 bond
 trader
 at
 Solomon,


what
 kind
 of
 a
 government
 can
 it
 be?


and
 and
 uh
 at
 any
 rate
 and
 this
 guy
 has


been
 part
 of
 a
 little
 clique
 that
 has


made


well
 way
 into
 way
 over
 a
 billion
 dollars


for
 Solomon
 in
 the
 very
 recent
 past
 and


it's
 little
 handful
 of
 people
 and
 so


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 psychological
 forces


at
 work
 and
 you
 know
 you
 know
 the
 guy's


wife
 and
 and
 he's
 right
 in
 front
 of
 you


and
 there's
 human
 sympathy
 and
 he's
 sort


uh
 asking
 for
 your
 help
 which
 is
 a
 form


which
 encourages
 reciprocation
 and
 there


all
 these
 psychological
 tendencies
 are


working
 plus
 the
 fact
 he's
 part
 of
 a


group
 that
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 for


you.
 At
 any


rate
 good
 friend
 does
 not
 cashier
 the


man
 and
 of
 course
 he
 had
 done
 it
 before


and
 he
 did
 do
 it
 again.
 Well,
 now
 you


look
 as


though
 you
 almost
 wanted
 him
 to
 do
 it


again
 or
 god
 knows
 what
 you
 look
 like,


but
 it
 isn't
 good.
 And
 uh
 and
 then
 that


simple
 decision
 destroyed
 John


Goodfriend.
 And
 uh
 and
 it's
 so
 easy
 to


do.
 Now,
 let's
 think
 it


through.
 like
 the
 bridge
 player
 like


Zehouser.
 You
 find
 an
 isolated
 example


of
 a
 little
 old
 lady
 in
 the
 seas
 candy


company,
 one
 of
 our
 subsidiaries,


getting
 into
 the
 till.
 And
 what
 does
 she


say?
 I
 never
 did
 it
 before.
 I'll
 never


do
 it
 again.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 ruin
 my


life.
 Please
 help
 me.
 And
 you
 know
 her


children
 and
 her
 friends
 and
 she's
 been


around
 30
 years
 and
 standing
 behind
 the


candy
 counter
 with
 swollen
 ankles
 and


you're
 an
 old
 lady.
 It
 isn't
 that


glorious
 a


life.
 and
 you're
 rich
 and
 powerful
 and


there
 she
 is.
 I
 never
 did
 it
 before.
 I


want
 to
 never
 do
 it
 again.
 Well,
 how


likely
 is
 it
 that
 she
 never
 did
 it


before?
 If
 you're
 going
 to
 catch
 10


embezzlements
 a
 year,
 what
 are
 the


chances
 that
 any
 one
 of


them
 applying
 what
 Tverki
 and
 Common


called
 baseline


information
 will
 be
 somebody
 who
 only


did
 it
] this


once
 and
 the
 people
 who
 have
 done
 it


before
 and
 are
 going
 to
 do
 it
 again,


what
 are
 they
 all
 going
 to
 say?
 Well,
 in


the
 history
 of
 the
 Seas
 Handy
 Company,


they
 always
 say,
 "I
 never
 did
 it
 before


and
 I'm
 never
 going
 to
 do
 it
 again.


and
 we
 cashier


them.
 It
 would
 be
 evil
 not
 to
 because


terribly
 behavior
 spreads.
 Remember
 what


was
 it?


Servico.
 I
 mean
 you
 you
 let
 that
 stuff


you
 got
 social
 proof.
 You
 got
 incentive


caused
 bias.
 You
 got
 a
 whole
 lot
 of


psychological
 factors
 that
 will
 cause


the
 evil
 behavior
 to
 spread
 and
 pretty


soon
 the
 whole
 damn
 your
 place
 is


rotten.
 The
 civilization
 is
 rotten.
 It's


not
 the
 right
 way
 to
 behave.
 And
 uh
 and


uh
 I
 will
 admit
 that
 I
 have
 when
 I
 knew


the
 wife
 and
 children,
 I
 have
 paid


severance
 pay
 when
 I
 fire


somebody
 for
 taking
 a
 mistress
 on
 a


extended
 foreign
 trip.
 It's
 not
 the


adultery
 I
 mind,
 it's
 the
 embezzlement.


And
 uh
 but


there
 I


wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't
 do
 it
 where
 a
 good


friend
 did
 it
 where
 they've
 been


cheating
 somebody
 else
 on
 my
 behalf.


There
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 cashier.
 But


if
 they're
 just
 stealing
 from
 you
 and


you
 get
 rid
 of
 them,
 I
 don't
 think
 you


need
 the
 last
 ounce
 of


vengeance.
 In
 fact,
 I
 don't
 think
 you


need
 any
 vengeance.
 I
 don't
 think


vengeance
 is
 much
 good.
 the


um
 now
 we
 come
 biased
 from
 over


influenced
 by
 extra
 evid


evidence.
 Here's
 one
 that
 I'm
 at
 least


$30
 million
 poor
 as
 I
 sit
 here
 giving


this
 little
 talk
 because
 I
 once
 bought


300
 shares
 of
 a
 stock
 and
 the
 guy
 called


me
 back
 and
 said
 I've
 got
 1,500
 more.
 I


said
 will
 you
 hold
 it
 for
 15
 minutes


while
 I
 think
 about


it?
 and
 the
 CEO
 of
 this
 company.
 I
 have


seen
 a
 lot
 of
 vivid
 peculiarities
 in
 a


long
 life,
 but
 this
 guy
 set
 a
 world


record.
 I'm
 talking
 about
 the
 CEO
 and
 I


just
 misweighed
 it.
 The
 truth
 of
 the


matter
 is
 his
 situation
 was
 foolproof.


He
 was
 soon
 going
 to
 be
 dead.
 I
 turned


down
 the
 extra
 1500
 shares
 and
 it's
 now


cost
 me
 $30
 million.
 And
 that's
 life
 in


the
 big
 city.
 And
 it
 wasn't
 something


where
 stock
 was
 generally


available.
 And
 uh
 so
 it's
 very
 easy
 to


misweigh
 the
 vivid
 evidence
 and
 good


friend
 did
 that
 when
 he
 looked
 into
 the


man's
 eyes
 and
 forgave
 the


colleague.
 And
 uh
 22
 stress
 induced


mental
 changes
 small
 and
 large
 temporary


and


permanent.
 The


uh
 oh
 no
 no no
 I'
 I've
 skipped
 one.


Mental


confusion
 caused
 by
 information
 not


arrayed
 in
 the
 mind
 in
 theory
 structures


creating
 sound
 generalizations
 developed


in
 response
 to
 the
 question
 why.
 Also


misinfluence
 from
 information
 that


apparently
 but
 not
 really
 answers
 the


question
 why.
 Also
 failure
 to
 obtain


deserved
 influence
 caused
 by
 not


properly
 explaining
 why.
 But
 we
 all
 know


people
 who
 flunk
 and
 they
 try
 and


memorize
 and
 they
 try
 and
 spout
 back
 and


they
 just
 doesn't
 work.
 The
 brain


doesn't
 work
 that
 way.
 You've
 got
 to


array
 facts
 on
 theory
 structures


answering
 the
 question
 why.
 If
 you
 don't


do
 that,
 you
 just
 you
 cannot
 handle
 the


world.
 And
 now
 we
 get
 to
 Forstein
 who


was
 the
 general
 counsel
 of
 Solomon
 when


Goodren
 made
 his
 big
 error.
 And
 Forstein


knew
 better.
 He
 told
 Goodfriend,
 "You


have
 to
 report
 this
 as
 a
 matter
 of


morality
 and
 prudent
 business
 judgment."


He
 said,
 "It's
 probably
 not
 illegal.


there's
 probably
 no
 legal
 duty
 to
 do
 it,


but
 you
 have
 to
 do
 it
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 of


prudent
 conduct
 and
 and
 proper
 dealing


with
 your
 main
 customer.
 And
 he
 said


that
 to
 Good
 Friend
 on
 at
 least
 two
 or


three
 occasions
 and
 he
 stopped
 and
 of


course
 the
 persuasion
 failed.
 And
 when


Good
 Friend
 went
 down,
 Forstein
 went


with
 him
 and
 it
 ruined
 a
 considerable


part
 of
 Forstein's
 life.
 Well,
 Forstein


was
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Harvard
 Law
 Review


made
 an
 elementary
 psychological


mistake.


You
 want
 to
 persuade
 somebody.
 You


really
 tell
 them
 why.
 And
 what
 have
 we


learned
 in
 lesson
 one?
 Incentives
 really


matter.
 He
 should
 have
 told
 and
 vivid


evidence
 really
 works.
 He
 should
 have


told
 good


friend
 you
 are
 likely
 to
 ruin
 your
 life


and
 disgrace
 your
 family
 and
 lose
 your


money.
 And
 is
 Moer
 worth


this?
 I
 know
 both
 men.
 and
 that
 would


have
 worked.
 So
 Fstein
 flunked


elementary
 psychology,
 this
 very


sophisticated,
 brilliant


lawyer,
 but
 don't
 you
 do
 that.
 It's
 not


very
 hard
 to
 do,
 you
 know,
 just


to
 to
 remember
 that
 why
 is
 terribly


important.
 Uh
 other
 normal
 limitations


of
 sensation,
 memory,
 cognition,
 and


knowledge.
 Well,
 I
 don't
 have
 time
 for


that.
 Uh
 stress
 induced
 mental
 changes.


Here
 my
 favorite
 example
 is
 is
 is
 the


great
 Pavlov
 and
 he
 had
 all
 these
 dogs


in
 cages
 which
 had
 all
 been
 conditioned


into
 changed
 behaviors
 and
 the
 great


Lennengrad
 flood
 came
 and
 the
 just
 went


right
 up
 and
 the
 dogs
 in
 a
 cage
 and
 the


dog


was
 had
 as
 much
 stress
 as
 you
 can


imagine
 a
 dog
 ever
 having.
 And
 the
 water


receded
 in
 time
 to
 save
 some
 of
 the
 dogs


and
 and
 Pavv
 noted
 that
 they'd
 had
 a


total
 reversal
 of
 their
 conditioned


personality.
 Well,
 being
 the
 great


scientist
 he
 was,
 he
 spent
 the
 rest
 of


his
 life
 giving
 nervous
 breakdowns
 to


dogs
 and
 and
 he
 learned
 a
 a
 hell
 of
 a


lot
 that
 I
 regard
 as
 very
 interesting.
 I


have
 never
 known
 any
 fraudian
 analyst


who
 knew
 anything
 about
 the
 last
 work
 of


Pav
 Pavof.
 And
 I've
 never
 met
 a
 lawyer


who
 understood
 that
 what
 Pavlov
 found


out
 with
 those
 dogs
 had
 anything
 to
 do


with
 programming
 and
 deprogramming
 and


cults
 and
 so
 forth.
 I
 mean
 the
 amount
 of


of
 elementary
 psychological
 ignorance


that
 is
 out
 there
 in
 high
 levels
 is
 is


very
 subm.
 Then
 we've
 got
 other
 common


mental
 illnesses
 and
 declines
 temporary


and
 permanent
 including
 the
 tendency
 to


lose
 ability
 through
 disuse.
 And
 then


I've
 got
 mental
 and
 organizational


confusion
 from
 say
 something
 syndrome.


Here
 my
 favorite
 thing
 is
 the
 bee,
 the


honey
 bee.
 And
 the
 honey
 bee
 goes
 out


and
 finds
 the
 nectar
 and
 he
 comes
 back.


He
 does
 a
 dance
 that
 communicates
 to
 the


other
 bees
 where
 the
 nectar
 is
 and
 they


go
 out
 and
 get
 it.
 Well,
 some
 scientist


who
 was
 clever
 like
 BF
 Skinner
 decided


to
 do
 an
 experiment.
 He
 put
 the
 nectar


straight
 up,
 way
 up.
 Well,
 in
 a
 natural


setting,
 there
 is
 no
 nectar
 way
 the
 hell


straight
 up.
 And
 the
 poor
 honeybee


doesn't
 have
 a
 genetic
 program
 that
 is


adequate
 to
 handle
 what
 he
 now
 has
 to


communicate.
 And
 you'd
 think
 the
 honey


bee
 would
 come
 back
 to
 the
 hive
 and


slink
 into
 a
 corner,
 but
 he
 doesn't.
 and


he
 comes
 into
 the
 hive
 and
 does
 this


incoherent
 dance.
 And
 all
 my
 life
 I've


been
 dealing
 with
 the
 human
 equivalent


of
 that


honeybee
 and
 and
 it's
 a
 very
 important


part
 of
 human
 organization
 ito
 set
 things
  ]

up
 so
 the
 noise
 and
 the
 reciprocation


and
 so
 forth
 of
 all
 these
 people
 who


have
 what
 I
 call
 say
 something
 syndrome


don't
 really
 affect
 the
 decisions.


Now
 the
 time
 has
 come
 to
 ask
 two
 or


three
 questions.
 This
 is
 the
 most


important
 question
 in
 this
 whole


talk.
 What
 happens
 when
 the
 standard


psychological
 tendencies
 combine?
 What


happens
 when
 the
 situation
 or
 the
 artful


manipulation
 of
 man
 causes
 several
 of


these
 tendencies
 to
 operate
 on
 a
 person


toward
 the
 same
 end
 at
 the
 same
 time?

 i
The
 clear
 answer
 is
 the
 combination


greatly
 increases
 power
 to
 change


behavior
 compared
 to
 the
 power
 of
 merely


one
 tendency
 acting
 alone.
 Examples
 are


Tupperware


parties.
 Tupperware
 has
 now
 made


billions
 of
 dollars
 out
 of
 a
 few


manipulative
 psychological
 tricks.
 It


was
 so
 slack
 that
 directors
 of
 Justin


Dart's
 company
 resigned
 when
 he
 crammed


it
 down
 his
 board's
 throat.
 And
 he
 was


totally
 right,
 by
 the
 way,
 judged
 by


economic
 outcomes.
 Mooney
 conversion


methods.
 Boy,
 do
 they
 work.
 He
 just


combines
 four
 or
 five
 of
 these
 things


together.
 The
 system
 of
 alcoholics


anonymous,
 a
 50%
 no
 drinking
 rate


outcome
 when
 everything
 else
 fails.
 It's


a
 very
 clever
 system
 that
 uses
 four
 or


five
 psychological
 systems
 at
 once


toward,
 I
 must
 say,
 a
 very
 good
 end.
 The


Mgrim
 experiment,
 see,
 Mgrim,
 it's
 been


widely
 interpreted
 as
 mere
 obedience.


But
 the
 truth
 of
 the
 matter
 is
 that
 the


experimentter
 who
 got
 the
 students
 to


give
 the
 heavy
 shocks
 in
 Mgrim,
 he


explained


why
 it
 was
 a
 false
 explanation.
 We
 need


this
 to
 look
 for
 scientific
 truth
 and
 so


on.
 That
 greatly
 changed
 the
 behavior
 of


the
 people.
 And
 number
 two,
 he
 worked


them
 up.
 Tiny
 shock,
 little
 larger,


little
 larger.
 So
 commitment
 and


consistency
 tendency
 and
 the
 contrast


principle
 were
 both
 working
 in
 favor
 of


this
 behavior.
 So
 again,
 it's
 four


different
 psychological


tendencies.
 That's
 when
 you
 get
 these


laooa
 effects,
 you
 will
 almost
 always


find
 four
 or
 five
 of
 these
 things


working
 together.
 When
 I
 was
 young,


there
 was
 a
 who
 done
 it
 hero
 who
 always


said
 share


sham.
 And
 what
 you
 should
 search
 for
 in


life
 is
 the
 combination
 because
 the


combination
 is
 likely
 to
 do
 you
 in.
 Or


if
 you're
 the
 inventor
 of
 Tupperware


parties,
 it's
 likely
 to
 make
 you


enormously
 rich
 if
 you
 can
 stand
 shaving


when
 you
 do
 it.


Then
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


cases
 is
 the
 McDonald
 Douglas
 airliner


evacuation


disaster.
 The
 government
 requires
 that


airliners
 pass
 a
 a
 bunch
 of
 tests.
 One


of
 them
 is
 evacuation.
 Get
 everybody


out.
 I
 think
 it's
 90
 seconds
 or


something
 like
 that.
 It's
 some
 short


period
 of
 time.
 Government
 has
 rules.


Make
 it
 very
 realistic.
 So
 on
 and
 so
 on.


You
 can't
 select
 nothing
 but
 20-year-old


athletes
 to
 evacuate
 your
 airliner.
 So


McDonald
 Douglas
 schedules
 one
 of
 these


things
 in
 a
 hanger
 and
 they
 make
 the


hanger
 dark
 and
 the
 concrete
 floor
 is
 25


ft
 down
 and
 they
 got
 these
 little
 rubber


shoots
 and
 they
 got
 all
 these
 old
 people


and
 they
 ring
 the
 bell
 and
 they
 all
 rush


out
 and
 in
 the
 morning
 when
 the
 first


test
 is
 done
 they
 create
 I
 don't
 know
 20


terrible
 injuries
 that
 will
 go
 off
 to


hospitals
 and
 of
 course
 they
 schedule


another
 one
 for
 the
 afternoon.


By
 the
 way,
 they
 didn't
 meet
 the
 time


schedule
 either,
 in
 addition
 to
 causing


all
 the
 injuries.
 Well,
 so
 what
 do
 they


do?
 They
 do
 it
 again
 in
 the


afternoon.
 Now
 they
 create
 20
 more


injuries
 and
 one
 case
 of
 a
 severed


spinal
 column
 with
 permanent
 unfixable


paralysis.
 These
 are
 engineers.
 These


are
 brilliant
 people.
 This
 is
 thought


through
 in
 a
 big
 bureaucracy.
 Again,


it's
 a
 combination
 of
 a
 tendency.


Authorities
 told
 you
 to
 do
 it.
 He's
 told


you
 to
 make
 it
 realistic.
 You've
 decided


to
 do
 it.
 You've
 decided
 to
 do
 it


twice.
 Incentive
 caused
 bias.
 If
 you


pass,
 you
 save
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 You
 got


to
 jump
 this
 hurdle
 before
 you
 can
 sell


your
 new
 airliner.
 Again,
 three,
 four,


five
 of
 these
 things
 work
 together
 and


it
 turns
 human
 brains
 into
 mush.
 And


maybe
 you
 think
 this
 doesn't
 happen
 in


picking


investments.
 If
 so,
 you're
 living
 in
 a


different
 world
 than
 I


am.
 Finally,
 the
 open
 outcry


auction.
 But
 the
 open
 outcry
 auction
 is


just
 made
 to
 turn
 the
 brain
 into
 mush.


You
 get
 social
 proof.
 The
 other
 guy
 is


bidding.
 You
 get
 reciprocation
 tendency.


You
 get
 deprival
 super
 reaction


syndrome.
 The
 thing
 is
 going
 away.
 I


mean,
 it's
 just


absolutely
 designed
 to
 to
 manipulate


people
 into
 idiotic


behavior.
 Finally,
 the
 institution
 of


the
 board
 of
 directors
 of
 a
 major
 human


American


company.
 Well,
 the
 top
 guy
 is
 sitting


there.
 He's
 an
 authority
 figure.


He's
 doing
 asine
 things.
 You
 look
 around


the
 board,
 nobody
 else
 is
 objecting.


Social
 proof
 it's
 okay.
 Reciprocation


tendency.
 He's
 raising
 the
 director's


fees
 every
 year.
 He's
 flying
 you
 around


in
 the
 corporate
 airplane
 to
 look
 at


interesting
 plants
 or
 whatever
 in
 the


hell
 they
 do.
 And
 you
 go
 and
 you
 really


get
 extreme
 dysfunction
 as
 a
 corrective


decision-making
 body
 in
 the
 typical


American
 board
 of
 directors.
 They
 only


act
 again
 the
 power
 of
 incentives.
 They


only
 act
 when
 it
 gets
 so
 bad
 that
 it


starts


reflecting
 making
 them
 look
 foolish
 or


threatening
 legal
 liability
 to
 them.


That's
 Munger's
 rule.
 I
 mean,
 there
 are


occasional


uh
 things
 that
 don't
 follow
 Munger's


rule,
 but
 by
 and
 large,
 the
 board
 of


directors
 is
 a
 very
 ineffective


corrector
 if
 the
 if
 the
 top
 guy
 is
 a


little
 nuts,
 which
 of
 course
 frequently


happens.
 The
 second
 question
 isn't
 this


list
 of
 ]standard
 psychological


tendencies
 improperly
 tautological


compared
 with
 a
 system
 of
 uglid
 that
 is


aren't
 there
 overlaps
 and
 can't
 some


items
 on
 the
 list
 be
 derived
 from


combinations
 of
 other
 items
 the
 answer


to
 that
 is
 plainly
 yes
 three
 what
 good


is
 in
 the
 practical
 world
 is
 the
 thought


system
 indicated
 by
 the
 list
 isn't


practical
 benefit
 prevented
 because


these
 psychological
 tendencies
 are


programmed
 into
 the
 human
 mind
 by
 broad


evolution
 so
 we
 can't
 get
 rid
 of
 broad


evolution
 I
 mean
 the
 combination
 of


genetic
 and
 cultural
 evolution,
 but


mostly
 genetic.
 Well,
 the
 answer
 is
 the


tendencies
 are
 partly
 good
 and
 indeed


probably
 much
 more
 good
 than
 bad.


Otherwise,
 they
 wouldn't
 be
 there.
 By


and
 large,
 these
 rules
 of
 thumb
 have


worked
 pretty
 well
 for
 man
 given
 his


limited
 mental
 capacity
 and
 that's
 why


they
 were
 programmed
 in
 by
 by
 broad


evolution.
 At
 any
 rate,
 they
 can't
 be


simply
 washed
 out
 automatically
 and
 they


shouldn't
 be.
 Nonetheless,
 the


psychological
 thought
 system
 described


is
 very
 useful
 in
 spreading
 wisdom
 and


good
 conduct
 and
 when
 one
 understands
 it


and
 uses
 it
 constructively.
 Here
 are


some


examples.
 Carl
 Braun's
 communication


practices
 designed
 oil
 refineries
 with


spectacular
 skill
 and


integrity.
 He
 had
 a
 very
 simple
 rule.


Remember
 I
 said
 why
 is


important.
 You
 got
 fired
 in
 the
 Brun


Company.
 You
 had
 to
 have
 five
 W's.
 You


had
 to
 tell
 who,
 what
 you
 wanted
 to
 do,


where,
 and
 when,
 and
 you
 had
 to
 tell
 him


why.
 And
 if
 you
 wrote
 a
 communication


and
 left
 out
 the
 why,
 you
 got
 fired.
 Cuz


Bronn
 knew.
 It's
 complicated
 building
 an


oil
 refiner.
 It
 can
 blow
 up.
 All
 kinds


of
 things
 happen.
 And
 he
 knew
 that
 his


communication
 system
 worked
 better
 if


you
 always
 told
 him
 why.
 That's
 a
 simple


discipline.
 And
 boy,
 does
 it
 work.
 Two,


the
 use
 of
 simulators
 in
 pilot
 training.


Here
 again,
 abilities
 attenuate
 with


disuse.
 Well,
 the
 simulator
 is
 God's


gift
 because
 you
 can
 keep
 them
 fresh.


The
 system
 of
 alcoholics
 anonymous.


That's
 certainly
 a
 constructive
 use
 of


somebody
 understanding
 psychological


tendencies.
 I
 think
 they
 just
 blundered


into
 it
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 fact.
 So,
 you
 can


regard
 it
 as
 kind
 of
 an
 evolutionary


outcome.
 But
 just
 because
 they
 blundered


into
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 you
 can't
 invent


its
 equivalent
 when
 you
 need
 it
 for
 a


good


purpose.
 Clinical
 training
 in
 medical


schools.
 Here's
 a
 profoundly
 correct
 way


of
 understanding
 psychology.
 The


standard
 practice


is
 watch
 one,
 do
 one,
 teach
 one.
 Boy,


does
 that
 pound
 in
 what
 you
 want
 pounded


in.
 Again,
 the
 consistency
 and


commitment


tendency.
 And
 uh
 that
 is
 a
 profoundly


correct
 way
 to
 teach
 clinical
 medicine.


The
 rules
 of
 the
 US
 constitutional
 comm


convention
 totally
 secret.
 No
 vote
 until


the
 final


vote
 then
 just
 one
 vote
 on
 the
 whole


constitution.
 very
 clever
 psychological


rules.
 And
 if
 they
 had
 a
 different


procedure,
 everybody
 would
 have


been
 pushed
 into
 a
 corner
 by
 his
 own


pronouncements
 and
 his
 own
 oratory
 and


his
 own
 and
 and
 no
 recorded
 votes
 until


the
 last
 one.
 And
 uh
 and
 they
 got
 it


through
 by
 a
 whisker
 with
 those
 wise


rules.
 We
 wouldn't
 have
 had
 the


Constitution
 if
 our
 forefathers
 hadn't


been
 so
 psychologically
 acute.
 And
 look


at
 the
 crowd
 we
 got
 now.


Six,
 the
 use
 of
 granny's
 rule.
 I
 love


this.
 One
 of
 the
 psychologists
 who
 works


at
 the
 center
 gets
 paid
 a
 fortune


running
 around
 America
 and
 he
 teaches


executives
 to
 manipulate
 themselves.


Now,
 Granny's
 rule
 is
 you
 you
 don't
 get


the
 ice
 cream
 unless
 you
 eat
 your


carrots.
 Well,
 Granny
 was
 a
 very
 wise


woman.
 That
 is
 a
 very
 good
 system.
 And


uh
 so
 this
 guy,
 very
 eminent


psychologist,
 he
 runs
 around
 the
 country


telling
 executives
 to
 organize
 their


day.
 So
 they
 force
 themselves
 to
 do


what's
 unpleasant
 and


important
 by
 doing
 that
 first
 and
 then


rewarding
 themselves
 with
 something
 they


really
 like
 doing.
 He
 is
 profoundly


correct.
 Seven,
 the
 Harvard
 Business


School's
 emphasis
 on
 decision
 trees.


When
 I
 was
 young
 and
 foolish,
 I
 used
 to


laugh
 at
 the
 Harvard
 Business
 School.
 I


said
 they're
 teaching
 28-year-old
 people


tihat
 high
 school
 algebra
 works
 in
 real


life.
 We're
 talking
 about
 elementary


probability.
 But
 later
 I
 I
 wised
 up
 and


I
 realized
 that
 it
 was
 very
 important


that
 they
 do
 that
 and
 better
 late
 than


never.
 Eight,
 the
 use
 of
 postmortems
 at


Johnson
 and
 Johnson.
 At
 most


corporations,
 if
 you
 make
 an
 acquisition


and
 it
 works
 out
 to
 be
 a
 disaster,
 all


the
 paperwork
 and


presentations
 that
 cause
 the
 dumb


acquisition
 to
 be
 made
 are
 quickly


forgotten.
 You
 got
 denial.
 You
 got


everything
 in
 the
 world.
 You
 got


Pavlovian
 association
 tendency.
 Nobody


wants
 to
 even
 be
 associated
 with
 the


damn
 thing
 or
 even
 mention
 it.
 Johnson


and
 Johnson,
 they
 make
 everybody
 revisit


their
 old
 acquisitions
 and
 wade
 through


the
 presentations.
 That
 is
 a
 very
 smart


thing
 to
 do.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 do
 the


same
 thing
 routinely.
 Nine.
 The
 great


example
 of
 Charles
 the
 Darwin
 is
 he


avoided
 confirmation


bias.
 Darwin
 probably
 changed
 my
 life


because
 I'm
 a
 biography
 nut.
 And
 and
 I


when
 I
 found
 out
 the
 way
 he
 always
 paid


extra
 attention
 to
 the
 disconfirming


evidence
 and
 all
 these
 little


psychological
 tricks,
 I
 also
 found
 out


that
 he
 wasn't
 very
 smart
 by
 the


standards
 the
 ordinary
 standards
 of


human
 acuity.
 Yet
 there
 ]he
 is
 buried
 in


Westminster
 Abbey.
 That's
 not
 where
 I'm


going,
 I'll
 tell
 you.
 And
 and
 I
 said,


"My
 god,
 here's
 a
 guy
 that
 by
 all


objective
 evidence
 is
 not
 nearly
 as


smart
 as
 I
 am,
 but
 he's
 in
 Westminster


Abbey.
 He
 must
 have
 tricks
 I
 should


learn."
 And
 I
 started
 wearing
 little


hair
 shirts
 like
 Darwin
 to
 try
 and
 train


myself
 out
 of
 these
 subconscious


psychological
 tendencies
 that
 cause
 so


many
 errors.
 It
 didn't
 work
 perfectly
 as


you
 can
 tell
 from
 listening
 to
 this


talk.
 But
 it
 would
 have
 would
 have
 been


even
 worse
 if
 I


hadn't
 hadn't
 done
 what
 I


did.
 And
 you
 can
 know
 these


psychological
 tendencies
 and
 avoid
 being


the
 psy
 of
 all
 the
 people
 that
 are


trying
 to
 manipulate
 you
 to
 your


disadvantage.
 Like
 Sam
 Walton.
 Sam


Walton
 will
 let
 a
 purchasing
 agent
 take


a
 handkerchief
 from
 a


salesman.
 He
 knows
 how
 powerful
 the


subconscious
 reciprocation
 tendency
 is.


That
 is
 a
 profoundly
 correct
 way
 for
 Sam


Walton
 to
 behave.
 Then
 there's
 the


Warren
 Buffett
 rule
 for
 openout
 cry


auctions.
 Don't


[Music]


go.
 We
 don't
 go
 to
 the
 close
 bid


auctions
 too
 because
 they
 that's
 a


counterproductive
 way
 to
 do
 things


ordinarily
 for
 a
 different
 reason
 which


Zehauser
 would
 understand.
 Four,
 what


special
 knowledge
 problems
 lie
 buried
 in


the
 thought
 system
 indicated
 by
 the


list?
 Well,
 one
 is
 paradox.
 Now
 we're


talking
 about
 a
 type
 of
 human
 wisdom


that
 the
 more
 people
 learn
 about
 it,
 the


more
 attenuated
 the
 wisdom


gets.
 That's
 an
 intrinsically


paradoxical
 kind
 of
 wisdom.
 But
 we
 have


paradox
 of
 mathematics
 and
 we
 don't
 give


up
 mathematics.
 I
 say
 damn
 the
 paradox.


This
 stuff
 is
 wonderfully


useful.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 the
 granny's


rule
 when
 you
 apply
 it
 to
 yourself
 is


sort
 of
 a
 paradox
 and
 a


paradox.
 The
 manipul
 the
 manipulation


still
 works
 even
 though
 you
 know
 you're


doing
 it.
 And
 I've
 seen
 that
 done
 by
 one


person
 to
 another.
 I
 drew
 this
 beautiful


woman
 as
 my
 dinner
 partner
 a
 few
 years


ago
 and
 I'd
 never
 seen
 her
 before,


a]lthough
 she's
 married
 to
 a
 prominent


Angelino.
 And
 she
 sat
 down
 next
 to
 me


and
 she
 turned
 her
 beautiful
 face
 up
 and


she
 said,
 "Charlie,"
 she
 said,
 "what
 one


word
 accounts
 for
 your
 remarkable


success
 in
 life?"
 Now,
 I
 knew
 I
 was


being
 manipulated
 and
 that
 she'd
 done


this
 before.
 And
 I
 just
 loved
 it.
 I
 I


I
 never
 see
 this
 woman
 without
 a
 little


lift
 in
 my


spirits.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 told
 her
 I
 i

was


rational.
 You'll
 have
 to
 judge
 yourself


whether
 that's
 true.
 I
 I
 may


be
 demonstrating
 some
 psychological


tendency
 I
 hadn't
 planned
 on


demonstrating.


How
 should
 the
 best
 parts
 of
 psychology


and
 economics
 interrelate
 in
 an


enlightened
 economist
 mind?
 Two
 views.


That's
 the
 thermodynamics
 model.
 You,


you
 know,
 you
 can't
 derive


thermodynamics
 from
 from
 Newtonian


uh
 gravity
 and
 and
 uh
 and
 laws
 of


mechanics
 even
 though
 it's
 a
 lot
 of


little
 particles
 interacting.
 And
 here's


this
 wonderful
 truth
 that
 you
 can
 sort


of
 develop
 on
 your
 own,
 which
 is


thermodynamics.
 and
 some
 economists
 and


I
 think
 Milton
 Freriedman
 is
 in
 this


group
 but
 I
 may
 be
 wrong
 on
 that.
 Sort


of
 like
 the
 thermodynamics


model.
 I
 think
 Milton
 Reeden
 Freriedman


who
 has
 a
 Nobel
 prize
 is
 probably
 a


little
 wrong
 on
 that.
 I
 think
 the


thermodynamics
 analogy
 is
 overstrained.


I
 think
 knowledge
 from
 these
 different


soft


sciences
 have
 to
 be
 reconciled
 to


eliminate
 conflict.


After
 all,
 there's
 nothing
 in


thermodynamics
 that's


inconsistent
 with
 Newtonian
 mechanics


and
 gravity.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 some
 of


these
 economic
 theories
 are
 not
 totally


consistent
 with
 other
 knowledge
 and
 they


have
 to
 be
 bent.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 these


behavioral
 economics
 are
 economists
 are


probably
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 bending
 them


in
 a
 correct
 direction.
 Now,
 my


prediction
 is
 when
 the
 economists
 take
 a


little
 psychology
 into
 account
 ithat
 the


reconciliation
 will
 be
 quite
 endurable.


And
 here
 my
 model
 is
 the
 procession
 of


the
 equinoxes.
 The
 world
 would
 be


simpler
 for
 a
 long-term
 climatologist
 if


the
 angle
 of
 the
 axis
 of
 the
 Earth's


rotation
 compared
 to
 the
 plane
 of
 the


eucalyptic
 were
 absolutely
 fixed.
 But
 it


isn't
 fixed.
 Over
 every
 40,000
 years
 or


so,
 there's
 this
 little
 wobble.
 And
 that


has
 pronounced
 long-term
 effects.
 Well,


in
 many
 cases,
 what
 psychology
 is
 going


to
 add
 is
 just
 a
 little
 wobble
 and
 it


will
 be
 endurable.
 Uh,
 here
 I
 I
 quote


another
 hero
 of
 mine
 who
 of
 course
 is


Einstein
 where
 he
 said,
 "The
 Lord
 is


subtle
 but
 not
 malicious."
 And
 I
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 that
 hard
 to
 bend


economics
 a
 little
 to
 to


um
 accommodate
 what's
 right
 in


psychology.
 The
 final
 question
 is,
 if


the
 t]hought
 system
 indicated
 by
 this


list
 of
 psychological
 tendencies
 has


great
 value
 not
 widely
 recognized
 and


employed,
 what
 should
 the
 educational


system
 do
 about
 it?
 I
 am
 not
 going
 to


answer
 that
 one
 now.
 I
 I
 like
 leaving
 a


little


mystery.
 Have
 I
 used
 up
 all
 the
 time?
 So


there's
 no
 time
 for
 questions.
 So
 I


think
 I
 think
 that
 what
 we're
 going
 to

 ]
do
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 borrow
 a
 little
 bit


of
 time
 from
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 summary


questions
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 move
 in
 and


allocate
 it
 to
 Charles
 that's
 why
 we


have
 questions


for
 we'll
 ask
 other
 people
 questions.
 By


the
 way,
 the
 dean
 of
 the
 Stanford
 Law


School
 is
 here
 today,
 Paul
 Breast,
 and


he
 is
 trying
 to
 create
 a
 course
 at
 the


Stanford
 Law
 School
 that
 tries
 to
 work


stuff
 similar
 to
 this


into
 worldly
 wisdom
 for
 lawyers,
 which
 I


regard
 as
 a
 profoundly
 good
 idea.
 And
 he


wrote
 an
 article
 about
 it,
 and
 you'll
 be


given
 a
 copy
 along
 with
 Seal
 Dean's


book.
 Questions?


Yeah.
 Will
 we
 be
 able
 to
 get
 a
 uh
 copy


that


Yes,
 I
 presume
 there
 would
 be
 one


curious


man
 and
 I
 have
 it.
 I'll
 put
 it
 over


there
 on
 the
 table,
 but
 don't
 take
 more


than
 one
 because
 I
 didn't
 anticipate


such
 a
 big
 crowd.
 And
 if
 we
 run
 short,


I'm
 sure
 the
 center
 is
 up
 to
 making


other
 copies


and
 questions.
 Yeah.


Well,
 let
 me
 just
 ask
 one
 question.
 If
 I


had
 listened
 to
 this
 talk,
 I
 might
 have


thought
 that
 you
 were
 a
 psychologist.
 I


can't
 hear
 you.
 If
 I
 had
 listened
 to


this
 talk,
 I
 might
 have
 thought
 that
 uh


Charles
 Munger
 was
 a
 psychology


professor
 operating
 at
 a
 business
 hall.


Every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 was
 a
 micro
 issue.


You
 told
 us
 uh
 how
 you
 would
 have
 dealt


with
 one
 of
 these
 issues.
 For example,


with
 the
 uh
 unfortunate
 lady
 from
 C's,


but
 you
 didn't
 tell
 us
 how
 these


tendencies
 affected
 you
 and
 what's


probably
 the
 most
 important
 or
 one
 of


the
 most
 important
 elements
 of
 your


success,
 which
 was
 deciding
 where
 to


invest
 your
 money.
 And
 I'm
 wondering
 if


uh
 you
 might
 relate
 some
 of
 these


principles
 to
 some
 of
 your
 past


decisions
 that
 I


Well,
 of
 course,
 an
 investment


decision
 in
 the
 common
 stock
 of
 a


company
 frequently
 involves
 a
 whole
 lot


of
 factors
 interacting.


Usually,
 of
 course,
 there's
 one
 big


simple
 model
 and
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 those


models
 are
 are
 microeconomic
 and
 I
 have


a
 little
 list
 of
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 nearly


24


uh
 of
 those,
 but
 I
 don't
 have
 time
 for


for
 that
 one.
 And
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 too


much
 interest
 in
 teaching
 other
 people


how
 to
 get
 rich.
 uh
 my
 personal
 and
 that


isn't
 because
 I
 fear
 the
 competition
 uh


or
 anything
 like
 that.
 Uh
 Warren
 has


always
 been
 very
 open
 about
 about
 what


he's
 learned
 and
 uh
 I
 I
 share
 that


ethos.
 My
 personal
 behavior
 model
 is
 is


Lord
 Kane's.
 I
 wanted
 to
 get
 rich
 so
 I

 i
could
 be
 independent


uh
 and
 so
 I
 could
 do
 other
 things
 like


give
 talks
 on
 the
 intersection
 of


psychology
 and
 economics.
 Uh,
 I
 didn't


want
 to
 turn
 it
 into
 a
 total
 obsession.


Yeah,


that
 was
 24.
 Could
 you
 tell
 us
 the
 one


rule
 is
 most
 important?


I
 would
 say
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 causes


the
 most
 trouble
 is
 when
 you
 combine
 a


bunch
 of
 these
 together,
 you
 get
 this


laalapooa
 effect.
 And
 if
 you
 again,
 if


you
 read
 the
 psychology


textbooks,
 they
 don't
 discuss
 how
 these


things
 combine,
 at least
 not
 very
 much.


Do
 they
 multiply?
 Do
 they
 add?
 What
 how


does
 it
 work?
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 just


an
 automatic
 subject
 for
 for
 research,


but
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 turn
 the


psychology
 establishment
 on.
 I
 think


this
 is
 a
 like
 this
 is
 a
 man
 for
 Mars


approach
 to
 psychology.
 I
 just
 reached


in
 and
 took
 what
 I
 thought
 I
 had
 to


have.
 ]

That
 is
 a
 different
 set
 of
 incentives


from
 rising
 in
 an
 economic
 establishment


where
 the
 reward
 system
 again
 the


reinforcement
 comes
 from
 being
 a
 truffle


hound.
 That's
 what
 Jacob
 Viner
 the
 great


economist
 called
 it
 the
 truffle
 hound.


An
 animal
 so
 bred
 and
 trained
 for
 one


narrow
 purpose
 that
 he
 wasn't
 much
 good


at
 anything
 else.
 And
 that
 is
 the
 reward


system
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 academic
 departments.

 ]
It
 is
 not
 necessarily
 for
 the
 good.
 It


may
 be
 fine
 if
 you
 want
 new
 drugs
 or


something.
 You
 want
 people
 stunted
 in
 a


lot
 of
 different
 directions.
 so
 they
 can


grow
 in
 one
 narrow
 direction.
 But
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 good
 ]teaching
  i

psychology
 to
 the
 the
 the
 masses.
 In


fact,
 I
 ]ithink
 it's
 terrible.
